<h1 class="explain"> To get a better idea of <span>how I think</span> and <span>solve problems</span> let's jump right into my workflow! <br>
What follows is a case study for an app to help users adopt healthy eating habits.</h1>

    <span>HYPOTHESIS:</span>
    <p>Increased personal accountability, community engagement, and incremental changes will lead users to make healthier eating choices.</p></div>
    <div class="takeaway_grid">
    <span>HOW:</span>
    <p>User engage in community discord, participate in weekly challenges; users are also given the ability to communicate with a certified nutritionist and 
    ability to report and help fight cravings all within the same community.</p>
</div>
<p class="work"> In this case study I focused on the main problem of unhealthy eating habits. I started out by listing all related problems,
        assumptions about behaviors, problems with current solutions, key success metrics, and product features. The above are my main takeaways from this step. Since the app relies on continous engagement to be successful,
         I"m also mindful of what the 'hook' will be for the platform to become a regular habit for users.</p>

            <span>GOAL:</span>
            <p>This tool will allow users to report anytime they are craving something unhealthy. Users will have the option to 'resist', to 'succumb', 
                or 'view alternative options'. The success metric for this tool is that over time there are more cravings reported as "Resisted" vs "Succumbed to".</p></div>
        <p class="work"> After mapping out the user flow for the platform, I decided to validate my hypothesis by focusing on getting feedback on the Report Cravings Tool.This feature lends to the <em>increase in personal accountability</em>
             of my hypothesis and getting feedback on this tool specifically will validate or invalidate whether this may be a useful part of the platform.

                        <p class="work">After completing the prototype for the Cravings Tool and coming up with a few variations of the home page I felt comfortable to get some feedback. Users were asked to compare the multiple design varations of the homepage and were also given a link to test out the prototype.
                             Participants used the prototype when they wanted to eat something unhealthy (this includes snacks high in fat and sugar, and fast food).

            <div class="takeaway_grid">
                    <span>RESULTS:</span>
                    <p>Four out of five participants were swayed away from their cravings and all were interested in learning more about the full platform. 
                        Version 3 of the homepage beat out Version 2 by a slim margin.</p></div>

                        <div class="takeaway_grid" style="grid-template-columns: 15% 77%;">
                                <span>Prototype Notes:</span>
                                <p>Knowing that the 'nutritionist' would be monitoring their decisions made users feel they should think more about their food choices.
                                     Also, a suggestion was made to allow for push notifications at certain day/times that ask if user's are craving, since times like weekends are when people tend to over-indulge. 
                                    The one participant who still indulged their cravings experienced the moral licensing effect; because she put in more effort into exercising that day she felt she deserved her sweet snack.</p></div>

                                    <div class="takeaway_grid" style="grid-template-columns: 15% 77%;">
                                            <span>Homepage Notes:</span>
                                            <p>Three participants liked Homepage Version 3 mostly due to it's "clean" look, while the other two favored Version 2 becuase of the vibrant and inviting color. No one seemed to like Version 1 as much :(</p></div>
                <p class="work"> In conclusion, more testing is needed <em>(as always!)</em> but the Cravings Tool has not been invalidated so far and may prove to be a useful addition to the platform.
